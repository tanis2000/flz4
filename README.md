# FLZ4 Uncompress Utility

This is a CLI to uncompress Fortinet files compressed with their custom LZ4 implementation.
This is especially useful for log files.

## Usage

```bash
uncompress <input-file>
```

This will create a file with the same name as the input file, but with `.dec` appended to the end.
